## About - v6.4

This is a tool used to discover endpoints (and potential parameters) for a given target. It can find them by:

- crawling a target (pass a domain/URL)
- crawling multiple targets (pass a file of domains/URLs)
- searching files in a given directory (pass a directory name)
- get them from a **Burp** project (pass location of a Burp XML file)
- get them from an **ZAP** project (pass location of a ZAP ASCII message file)
- get them from a **Caido** project (pass location of a Caido export CSV file)
- processing a [waymore](https://github.com/xnl-h4ck3r/waymore) results directory (searching archived response files from `waymore -mode R` and also requesting URLs from `waymore.txt` and the original URLs from `index.txt` - see [waymore README.md](https://github.com/xnl-h4ck3r/waymore/blob/main/README.md))

The python script is based on the link finding capabilities of my Burp extension [GAP](https://github.com/xnl-h4ck3r/burp-extensions).
As a starting point, I took the amazing tool [LinkFinder](https://github.com/GerbenJavado/LinkFinder) by Gerben Javado, and used the Regex for finding links, but with additional improvements to find even more.

| -ra         | --regex-after              | RegEx for filtering purposes against found endpoints before output (e.g. `/api/v[0-9]\.[0-9]\*` ). If it matches, the link is output.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -d          | --depth †                  | The level of depth to search. For example, if a value of 2 is passed, then all links initially found will then be searched for more links (default: 1). This option is ignored for Burp files, ZAP files and Caido files because they can be huge and consume lots of memory. It is also advisable to use the `-sp` (`--scope-prefix`) argument to ensure a request to links found without a domain can be attempted.                                                                              |
| -p          | --processes †              | Basic multithreading is done when getting requests for a URL, or file of URLs (not a Burp file, ZAP file or Caido file). This argument determines the number of processes (threads) used (default: 25)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| -orig       | --origin                   | Whether you want the origin of the link to be in the output. Displayed as `LINK-URL [ORIGIN-URL]` in the output (default: false)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

† NOT RELEVANT FOR INPUT OF DIRECTORY, BURP XML FILE, OWASP ZAP FILE OR CAIDO CSV FILE

## config.yml

The `config.yml` file (typically in `~/.config/xnLinkFinder/`) has the keys which can be updated to suit your needs:

- `linkExclude` - A comma separated list of strings (e.g. `.css,.jpg,.jpeg` etc.) that all links are checked against. If a link includes any of the strings then it will be excluded from the output. If the input is a directory, then file names are checked against this list.
- `contentExclude` - A comma separated list of strings (e.g. `text/css,image/jpeg,image/jpg` etc.) that all responses `Content-Type` headers are checked against. Any responses with the these content types will be excluded and not checked for links.
- `fileExtExclude` - A comma separated list of strings (e.g. `.zip,.gz,.tar` etc.) that all files in Directory mode are checked against. If a file has one of those extensions it will not be searched for links. Also, in normal mode, if a response doesn't have a content-type to check for exclusions, it will check for these extensions at the end of the URL to determine if to search for links.
- `regexFiles` - A list of file types separated by a pipe character (e.g. `php|php3|php5` etc.). These are used in the Link Finding Regex when there are findings that aren't obvious links, but are interesting file types that you want to pick out. If you add to this list, ensure you escape any dots to ensure correct regex, e.g. `js\.map`
- `respParamLinksFound` † - Whether to get potential parameters from links found in responses: `True` or `False`
- `respParamPathWords` † - Whether to add path words in retrieved links as potential parameters: `True` or `False`
- `respParamJSON` † - If the MIME type of the response contains JSON, whether to add JSON Key values as potential parameters: `True` or `False`
- `respParamJSVars` † - Whether javascript variables set with `var`, `let` or `const` are added as potential parameters: `True` or `False`
- `respParamXML` † - If the MIME type of the response contains XML, whether to add XML attributes values as potential parameters: `True` or `False`
- `respParamInputField` † - If the MIME type of the response contains HTML, whether to add NAME and ID attributes of any INPUT fields as potential parameters: `True` or `False`
- `respParamMetaName` † - If the MIME type of the response contains HTML, whether to add NAME attributes of any META tags as potential parameters: `True` or `False`
- `wordsContentTypes` - A comma separated list of strings (e.g. `text/html,text/plain`) to specify which response content types will be searched for words to go in the target specific wordlist.
- `stopWords` - A comma separated list of strings (e.g. `then,this,that`) to specify words that are excluded from the target specific wordlist. This default list is initially made up of English determiners, coordinating conjuctions and prepositions, plus a list of stop words from Scikit-Learn, a python machine learning library.

† IF THESE ARE NOT FOUND IN THE CONFIG FILE THEY WILL DEFAULT TO `True`

## Examples

### Find Links from a specific target - Basic

```
xnLinkFinder -i target.com -sf target.com
```

### Find Links from a specific target - Detailed

Ideally, provide scope prefix (`-sp`) with the primary domain (including schema), and a scope filter (`-sf`) to filter the results only to relevant domains (this can be a file or in scope domains). Also, you can pass cookies and customer headers to ensure you find links only available to authorised users.
Specifying the User Agent (`-u desktop mobile`) will first search for all links using desktop User Agents, and then try again using mobile user agents. There could be specific endpoints that are related to the user agent given. Giving a depth value (`-d`) will keep sending request to links found on the previous depth search to find more links.

```
xnLinkFinder -i target.com -sp target_prefix.txt -sf target_scope.txt -spo -inc -vv -H 'Authorization: Bearer XXXXXXXXXXXXXX' -c 'SessionId=MYSESSIONID' -u desktop mobile -d 10
```

### Find Links from a list of URLs - Basic

If you have a file of JS file URLs for example, you can look for links in those:

```
xnLinkFinder -i target_js.txt -sf target.com
```

### Find Links from a files in a directory - Basic

If you have a files, e.g. JS files, HTTP responses, etc. you can look for links in those:

```
xnLinkFinder -i ~/.config/waymore/results/target.com
```

NOTE: Sub directories are also checked. The `-mfs` option can be specified to skip files over a certain size.

### Find Links from a Burp project - Basic

In Burp, select the items you want to search by highlighting the scope for example, right clicking and selecting the `Save selected items`. Ensure that the option `base64-encode requests and responses` option is checked before saving.
To get all links from the file (even with HUGE files, you'll be able to get all the links):

```
xnLinkFinder -i target_burp.xml
```

NOTE: xnLinkFinder makes the assumption that if the first line of the file passed with `-i` starts with `<?xml` then you are trying to process a Burp file.

### Find Links from a Burp project - Detailed

Ideally, provide scope prefix (`-sp`) with the primary domain (including schema), and a scope filter (`-sf`) to filter the results only to relevant domains.

```
xnLinkFinder -i target_burp.xml -o target_burp.txt -sp https://www.target.com -sf target.* -ow -spo -inc -vv
```

### Find Links from an OWASP ZAP project - Basic

In ZAP, select the items you want to search by highlighting the History for example, clicking menu `Export` and selecting `Export Messages to File...`. This will let you save an ASCII text file of all requests and responses you want to search.
To get all links from the file (even with HUGE files, you'll be able to get all the links):

```
xnLinkFinder -i target_zap.txt
```

NOTE: xnLinkFinder makes the assumption that if the first line of the file passed with `-i` is in the format `==== 99 ==========` (v2.11.1) or `===99 ==========` (v2.12) for example, then you are trying to process an OWASP ZAP ASCII text file.

### Find Links from a Cadio export CSV file - Basic

In Caido, go to the **History** section and select the **Export** option.

If you are using Caido Pro or Enterprise edition, then choose the **Export current rows** option and pick **As CSV**. Go to the **Exports** section and download the CSV file. Then pass as input:

```
xnLinkFinder -i 2023-03-18-010332_csv_requests.csv
```

If you are using Caido Community edition, then you will have to choose the **Export all** option and pick **As CSV**. Go to the **Exports** section and download the CSV file. As you have the full history, you will want to remove anything that is not relevant from the CSV file. Use the example below, where `redbull` is the main part of the domains of the target you are looking at.

```
cat 2023-03-18-010332_csv_requests.csv | grep -E '^id|^[0-9]+,[^,]*redbull' > caido_redbull.csv
xnLinkFinder -i caido_redbull.csv
```

NOTE: xnLinkFinder makes the assumption that if the first line of the file passed with `-i` is in the format `id,host,method`, then you are trying to process a Caido export CSV file.

### Find Links from a Waymore results directory

The [waymore](https://github.com/xnl-h4ck3r/waymore) tool can be used to get URLs from various third party APIs, and also download archived responses from archive.org (Wayback Machine). Passing a waymore results directory to `xnLinKFinder` will search the contents of archived responses, and also request URLs from `waymore.txt` and also the archived URLs from `index.txt` and get more links from those responses.

```
xnLinkFinder -i ~/Tools/waymore/results/target.com
```

NOTE: It is passed as a normal directory, but xnLinkFinder will determine it is a waymore results directory and process respectively. This relies on the default naming convention of the URLs file being `waymore.txt` and that file being in the same directory as the archived files (which it is by default).

### Piping to other Tools

You can pipe xnLinkFinder to other tools. Any errors are sent to `stderr` and any links found are sent to `stdout`. The output file is still created in addition to the links being piped to the next program. However, potential parameters are not piped to the next program, but they are still written to file. For example:

```
xnLinkFinder -i redbull.com -sp https://redbull.com -sf rebbull.* -d 3 | unfurl keys | sort -u
```

You can also pass the input through `stdin` instead of `-i`.

```
cat redbull_subs.txt | xnLinkFinder -sp https://redbull.com -sf rebbull.* -d 3
```

NOTE: You can't pipe in a Burp, ZAP or Caido file, these must be passed using `-i`.

## Recommendations and Notes

- Always use the Scope Prefix argument `-sp`. This can be one scope domain, or a file containing multiple scope domains.
  Below are examples of the format used (no path should be included, and no wildcards used. Schema is optional, but will default to http):
  ```
  http://www.target.com
  https://target-payments.com
  https://static.target-cdn.com
  ```
  If a link is found that has no domain, e.g. `/path/to/example.js` then giving passing `-sp http://www.target.com` will result in teh output `http://www.target.com/path/to/example.js` and if Depth (`-d`) is >1 then a request will be able to be made to that URL to search for more links. If a file of domains are passed using `-sp` then the output will include each domain followed by `/path/to/example.js` and increase the chance of finding more links.
- If you use `-sp` but still want the original link of `/path/to/example.js` (without a domain) additionally returned in the output, the pass the argument `-spo`.
- Always use the Scope Filter argument `-sf`. This will ensure that only relevant domains are returned in the output, and more importantly if Depth (`-d`) is >1 then out of scope targets will not be searched for links or parameters. This can be one scope domain, or a file containing multiple scope domains. Below are examples of the format used (no schema or path should be included):
  ```
  target.*
  target-payments.com
  static.target-cdn.com
  ```
  THIS IS FOR FILTERING THE LINKS DOMAIN ONLY.
- If you want to filter the final output in any way, use `-ra`. It's always a good idea to use https://regex101.com/ to check your Regex expression is going to do what you expect.
- Use the `-v` option to have a better idea of what the tool is doing.
- If you have problems, use the `-vv` option which may show errors that are occurring, which can possibly be resolved, or you can raise as an issue on github.
- Pass cookies (`-c`), headers (`-H`) and regex (`-ra`) values within single quotes, e.g. `-ra '/api/v[0-9]\.[0-9]\*'`
- Set the `-o` option to give a specific output file name for Links, rather than the default of `output.txt`. If you plan on running a large depth of searches, start with 2 with option `-v` to check what is being returned. Then you can increase the Depth, and the new output will be appended to the existing file, unless you pass `-ow`.
- Set the `-op` option to give a specific output file name for Potential Parameters, rather than the default of `parameters.txt`. Any output will be appended to the existing file, unless you pass `-ow`.
- If using a high Depth (`-d`) be wary of some sites using dynamic links so will it will just keep finding new ones. If no new links are being found, then xnlLinkFinder will stop searching. Providing the Stop flags (`s429`, `s403`, `sTO`, `sCE`) should also be considered.
- If you are finding a large number of links, especially if the Depth (`-d` value) is high, and have limited resources, the program will stop when it reaches the memory Threshold (`-m`) value and end gracefully with data intact before getting killed.
- If you decide to cancel xnLinkFinder (using `Ctrl-C`) in the middle of running, be patient and any gathered data will be saved before ending gracefully.
- Using the `-orig` option will show the URL where the link was found. This can mean you have duplicate links in the output if the same link was found on multiple sources, but it will suffixed with the origin URL in square brackets.
- When making requests, xnLinkFinder will use a random User-Agent from the current group, which defaults to `desktop` (unless the `-uc`/`--user-agent-custom` argument is used). If you have a target that could have different links for different user agent groups, then specify `-u desktop mobile` for example (separate with a space). The `mobile` user agent option is an combination of `mobile-apple`, `mobile-android` and `mobile-windows`. Possible values are `desktop`, `mobile`, `set-top-boxes` and `game-console`.
- When `-i` has been set to a directory, the contents of the files in the root of that directory will be searched for links. Files in sub-directories are not searched. Any files that are over the size set by `-mfs` (default: 500 MB) will be skipped.
- When using the `-replay-proxy` option, sometimes requests can take longer. If you start seeing more `Request Timeout` errors (you'll see errors if you use `-v` or `-vv` options) then consider using `-t` to raise the timeout limit.
- If you know a target will only have ASCII characters in links and parameters then consider passing `-ascii-only`. This can eliminate a number of false positives that can sometimes get returned from binary data.
- If you pass a [waymore](https://github.com/xnl-h4ck3r/waymore) results directory, it is worth passing the `-d`/`--depth` argument to search any extra links found from URL requests and also the `-u`/`--user-agent` if you think there could be different content found, e.g. `-u desktop mobile`.
- Always pass the `-owl`/`--output-wordlist` filename to save the target specific wordlist. This list can be very useful when fuzzing a target.
- The words for the target specific wordlist are taken from the following sources (any of 3 characters or more), but are also determined by the other wordlist arguments (see Usage section above):
  - All responses with certain conditions:
    - Only responses with content types specific in the YML config `wordsContentTypes` section are searched. The defaults are `text/html`,`application/xml`,`application/json`,`text/plain`
    - Words from `<meta>` tag content where:
      - `Property` is `og:title` or `og:description`
      - `Name` is `description`,`keywords`,`twitter:title` or `twitter:description`
    - Words from HTML comments
    - Words from `alt` attribute of `<img>` tags
    - Words from the rest of the inner HTML of the page, excluding tags `<style>`, `<script>` and `<link`>
  - Words found from path words in links found.
  - Parameters found from responses and links.
  - All valid words will also have the singular/plural version added to the wordlist if possible.
  - If the original word has any upper case characters, a lower case version will also be added
- If the default "Stop Words" for a target specific wordlist are not good enough, either change in the YML config file, or provide additional stop words using the `-swf`/`--stopwords-file` option. You may want to include stop words in another language, depending on the target. Stop words are used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and many stop word lists can be found online to suit different needs.

## Issues

If you come across any problems at all, or have ideas for improvements, please feel free to raise an issue on Github. If there is a problem, it will be useful if you can provide the exact command you ran and a detailed description of the problem. If possible, run with `-vv` to reproduce the problem and let me know about any error messages that are given.

## TODO

- I seem to have completed all the TODO's I originally had! If you think of any that need adding, let me know 🤘
